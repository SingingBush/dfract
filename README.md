[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SingingBush/dfract.png)](https://travis-ci.org/SingingBush/dfract)

GTK application written in [D](http://dlang.org).

The project uses the [DUB](http://code.dlang.org/download) build tool to handle dependencies and compile. If you already have D and dub installed you can compile the project by simply cloning the repository and running `dub` in the root of the project.
